Program Name: Employee Management System [v2.0]
Author: Buland Jayeshkumar Shah (Alukard.007)
Country: India
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project is an update from the previous 1.0 version.

This version has pure data storage and manipulation based on File-Handling and Encryption/ Decryptions.

Major focus in this version was laid on its Graphical User Interface, for which I went through Tkinter online guides and documentations, later successfully creating the application design, all by myself.

The screenshots of the working application can be found in the "A3-Project Report" document.

The supplementary files:
- IDpass.txt
- EncryptedDB.txt
- EmployeeDB.txt
are required to be present in the same directory as "EmployeeManagementSystem[v2.0].exe" and the "SourceCode.py" files for them to execute.

This amendment in the version was carried out from Decemeber 2021 to February 2022. It was only in December 2021 that I bought my first laptop:)
