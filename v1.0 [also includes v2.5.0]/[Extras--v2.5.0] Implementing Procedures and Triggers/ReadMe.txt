PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Employee Management System is a software application designed to help organizations manage employee data and streamline various HR-related tasks. The system we created using the provided procedures and triggers allows for the efficient management of employee salary, attendance, leaves, performance, and department information.
The system maintains a record of employee details, including their personal information, such as date of birth, first name, last name, gender, and department. It also tracks the salary information of employees, including basic salary, overtime pay, other allowances, deductions, and net salary. This information is stored in the EMSemployee and salary tables.
The Attendance table keeps a record of the attendance of employees for each month of the year. The table helps to calculate the total working days of employees and enables the organization to keep track of their attendance performance.
The MonthlySalary table stores the final salary of employees for each month of the year, which is calculated based on the basic salary and the attendance of the employee for that month.
The Leaves_Taken and Leave_Eligibility tables are used to track employee leaves, including the type of leave, start and end dates, and the reason for the leave. The Leave_Eligibility table also keeps track of the number of leaves an employee is eligible for and the number of leaves remaining.
The Performance and Projects tables help the organization track the performance of employees based on their work on different projects. The Performance table stores employee performance data, including on-time completion, quality of work, and team contribution. The Projects table stores project information, including the project name, start and end dates, project manager, and status.
The department table maintains a record of all the departments in the organization, including the name of the department, department head, budget, and number of employees.
The audits table tracks all changes made to the tables in the system, including the table name, transaction name, user name, and transaction date. This table helps to keep track of all modifications made to the system by the users. 
In the project, we provide basic data manipulation and data retrieval functions like viewing table and adding records, updating records and deleting records, which are performed by MySQL triggers created by us and interfaced in Python using the call_proc() function of the mysql.connector module.
Furthermore, we also provide the functionality to fill a leave application form. Additional functions include generating an employeeâ€™s attendance, salary or performance report, which are backed by triggers.
In summary, the Employee Management System we created using the provided procedures and triggers helps organizations to manage their employee data efficiently and streamlines various HR-related tasks such as salary management, attendance tracking, leave management, performance tracking, and department management.
